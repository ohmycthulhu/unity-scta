# Unity-SCTA
In aviation, there are two methods for avoiding collisions between airplanes: SCTA and TCAS. SCTA is performed by dispatchers, when they see collision posibility and tell pilots to change the speed or altitude. TCAS is used by pilots, when dispatcher couldn't solve collision.

# What program does
This program is simulation of dispatcher program, where planes are showed on screen along with their altitude, speed and flight direction. When there could be collision between planes, planes are colored red and user can take control of these planes and set desired height and speed. If user couldn't solve this collision in some time frame, then TCAS is automatically takes control of planes.

The program contains two views: dispatcher and "on plane" view. To move from dispatcher view to "on plane", click on the plane and then click "POV" button. To move back, click "Back" button.
